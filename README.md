# ðŸŒ¿ Pollen Classification with EfficientNetB3

This project focuses on classifying microscopic pollen images using deep learning techniques. An EfficientNetB3 model was fine-tuned to distinguish between different pollen species captured from academic microscopy sources.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Microscopic pollen images were collected and labeled from a scientific textbook and uploaded to Kaggle:

ðŸ”— **Kaggle Dataset**:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emresebatiyolal/pollen-image-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emresebatiyolal/pollen-image-dataset)

- Multiple pollen species
- Original high-resolution color microscope images
- Folder structure: one class per folder

## ðŸ¤– Model

A CNN model based on **EfficientNetB3** architecture was trained on the dataset.

- Input shape: 300x300 RGB
- Preprocessing: Keras `preprocess_input`
- Trained using grayscale-to-RGB converted images for consistency
- Top-5 class probabilities shown in output
